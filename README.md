# Wireframing

## Introduction

Wireframing is the process of creating a simple visual guide that represents the structure and layout of a user interface. It focuses on the placement of elements such as headers, buttons, images, and content without emphasizing colors, fonts, or detailed design.

## Importance of Wireframing

Wireframing is an important step in the design process because it helps designers and developers:

- Visualize the basic structure of a product early
- Identify usability issues before development begins
- Communicate ideas clearly with stakeholders and team members
- Save time and cost by reducing unnecessary revisions
- Focus on functionality and user experience rather than visual details

By using wireframes, teams can ensure that the final product meets user needs and project goals before moving into high-fidelity design and development.
